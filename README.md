# Crestron-Home-Extension-Driver-Template

These files make up a template for writing extension drivers for Crestron Home. Normally this project is shared as a full Visual Studio solution zip, but the complete solution is larger than GitHub's file-size limits.

## Converting this template into a production Crestron Home driver

This repository is the starting point. A functioning driver still requires device-specific transport logic, protocol parsing, command/feedback wiring, and metadata/UI completion.

### Still needed (specific links)

Please share direct links to the exact pages for:

1. Transport implementation examples specific to your target protocol/device class (if available).

> Note: Packaging/Manifest Utility steps can be handled at the end and are not required to start core driver implementation.

## Implementation plan mapped to this template

1. Define v1 feature scope for a target device (power, inputs, volume, mute, feedback/events).
2. Build device transport/session handling in `Device_Name_Transport.cs`.
3. Implement command format + response parsing in `Device_Name_Protocol.cs`.
4. Connect lifecycle, actions, and feedback publication in `Device_Name.cs`.
5. Finalize runtime settings/metadata in `Settings_Data.cs` and `Device_Name.json`, and add UI translation strings in `en-US.json`.
6. Finalize UI metadata in `UiDefinition.xml`.
7. Validate on hardware (or an emulator) and iterate on timing/error-handling edge cases.
8. Perform end-of-cycle packaging/manifest steps after functional behavior is complete.

## Immediate next step from the docs provided

Using the "Create a Project," "Extension Drivers," "UI Files," SDK Architecture guidance, Best Practices guidance, and full SDK API reference, we can now begin implementation by replacing template placeholders with concrete driver identity values and scaffolding required driver classes/methods directly against the API docs before filling in transport/protocol specifics.

## Device details needed before coding

- Manufacturer + exact model number(s).
- Firmware version(s) to support.
- Official protocol/API reference for the device.
- Required commands/feedback for v1.
- Known quirks (rate limits, login/auth flow, warmup timing, unsolicited feedback behavior).
